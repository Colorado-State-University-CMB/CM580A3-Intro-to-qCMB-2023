# Intro to command line
Who, what, where, when, when, why and how. 

 - **What?**
Text interface to computer. As opposed to a GUI. 
 - **Why?**
Basic. Versatile. Designed for automation. 
 - **How?**

You: the biologist, analyzer of data, the user of open source. 
 - **Where?**
   - On Mac: search (cmd-space) for Terminal, or go to Applications/Utilities
   - On Windows: open your linux subsystem app.
   - Both: make a shortcut, leave in Dock. Make it easy on yourself to find again.


## What

 - GUI:
   - mouse
   - screen draws windows
   - menus, pull down boxes, etc.
 - Command line:
   - keyboard 
   - screen displays text (but scrollable) 
   - commands are typed out, submitted with enter key 

### The "shell" 

The *shell* wraps around the *kernel*. Shell means interface, kernel means operating system. 

Basic level:
 - runs programs 
 - navigate files
 - provide utilities for user (system info, internet, searching) 
 - configuration, preferences 

Next level:
  - install software (open source haven) 
  - create pipelines (natural progression of the shell "pipes") 
  - automate tasks (shell commands/pipelines in scripts)
