# Navigating the file system

## Hierarchical Organization

All computers/OSs use a tree-like structure to keep
user files separated from system files.

 - user files
   - Documents, Downloads, Desktop
   - Attached storage (thumb drive, external HD)
   - Network (including Cloud servers like OneDrive, Google Drive)
 - system/OS files
   - OS programs and data
