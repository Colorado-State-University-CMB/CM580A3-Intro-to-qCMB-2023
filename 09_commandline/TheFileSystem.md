All computers/OSs use a tree-like structure to keep
user files separated from system files.

   - Can freely read/write/delete
   - Documents, Downloads, Desktop
   - Attached storage (thumb drive, external HD)
   - Network (including Cloud servers like OneDrive, Google Drive)
 - system/OS files
   - OS programs and data
   - can make changes as administrator 
 - user installed software
